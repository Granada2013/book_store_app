# book_store_app
The task was to make an React SPA from scratch for a book store with the following functions: 
1. Show the list of books avaliable
2. Customer picks a book --> a modal window with book info should open
3. Customer picks number of books and adds it to cart. If 3+ pieces of single book were picked --> warning alert should show up ("Not enough books in stock")
4. The cart widget indicates the number of books in a cart (1 title = 1 book)
5. Customer can change number of books in the cart or delete a book from cart
